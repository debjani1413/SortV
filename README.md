# SortV

This is a web application built using HTML, CSS, Javascript to visualize classic sorting algorithms such as bubble, insertion, selection sort.
Making this sorting visualizer web application has improved my skills more in HTML, CSS, and JS. It has also helped me to improve my knowledge in sorting algorithms.
